# Convolutional-neural-networks-for-visual-recognition

In this I have worked with a toy 2D dataset and trained both a linear network and a 2-layer Neural Network.
We can see  that the change from a linear classifier to a Neural Network involves very few changes in the code.
The score function changes its form (1 line of code difference), and the backpropagation changes its form.
A linear classifier is inadequate for this dataset and we would like to use a Neural Network.
One additional hidden layer will suffice for this toy data.
